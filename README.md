# About the project

Tensorflow input pipeline is used in data preprocessing to accelerate this step. The classifier is trained by CNN.

The data contains around 25k images of size 150x150 distributed under 6 categories. {'buildings' -> 0, 'forest' -> 1, 'glacier' -> 2, 'mountain' -> 3, 'sea' -> 4, 'street' -> 5 }
